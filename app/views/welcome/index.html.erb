<p>I am originally from California. I visited Atlanta several years ago for business reasons. The affordability, weather and general friendliness of the community was impressive. I returned home and closed all affairs in California and moved to Atlanta.
</p>

<p>I have worked as a Sales and Use Tax Professional with the manufacturing, retail and service industries. My role included tax compliance, account analysis, tax audit defense and technology.
</P>

<p>After spending a huge portion of my career in this field, I decided to transition to another career. Technology has always peaked my interest. A friend recommended researching the coding  schools/programs that are very popular in Silicon Valley. In the fall of 2013, a discovered a coding program in Atlanta and reached out to the program's leadership and applied.</p>

<p>I was accepted and started the program in January 2014.
